# Roadmap

To add some order to this project these objectives need to be completed.

[ x ] basic gui features (open file, save, quit)

[ x ] gui theme

[ x ] pane grid

[ x ] file type recognition

[ x ] code icons 

### Explore: system shell in gui
A shell widget within iced seems the most simple out of the first few widgets and it is very helpful to users. Revisiting this idea, `iced_term` is what should be used.

### Program: custom text editor widget
We require highlighting and tooltips when the LSP gives us warnings or errors. Also look into inline hints with in the text editor.

### Program: A LSP client
My personal understanding is next to none current, so this will be a giant undertaking.

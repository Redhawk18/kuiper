# Roadmap

To add some order to this project these objectives need to be completed.

[x] basic gui features (open file, save, quit)

[x] gui theme

[x] pane grid

[x] file type recognition

[x] code icons 

### Explore: system shell in gui
A shell widget within iced seems the most simple out of the first few widgets and it is very helpful to users. Revisiting this idea, `iced_term` is what should be used.

### Program: custom text editor widget
We require highlighting and tooltips when the LSP gives us warnings or errors. Also look into inline hints with in the text editor.
